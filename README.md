## Configuration

### How to change providers

Open `.env.local` and change the value of `COMMERCE_PROVIDER` to the provider you would like to use, then set the environment variables for that provider (use `.env.template` as the base).

The setup for Shopify would look like this for example:

```
COMMERCE_PROVIDER=shopify
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=xxxxxxx.myshopify.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_CHECKOUT_DOMAIN=checkout.xxxxxxx.com
```

And check that the `tsconfig.json` resolves to the chosen provider:

```
"@framework": ["framework/shopify"],
"@framework/*": ["framework/shopify/*"]
```

That's it!

## Deployment

I recommend deploy this project to Vercel, but you can deploy to any PaaS.
